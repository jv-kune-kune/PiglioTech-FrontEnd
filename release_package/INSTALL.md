## APK Installation

1. **Enable Unknown Sources**:

   - On newer Android versions, you may be prompted to allow installation when you try to install the app

2. **Install the App**:
   - Download the `PiglioTech-1.0.0.apk` file to your Android device
   - Tap on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it
   - Once installed, you can find the app in your app drawer

3. **First Run**:
   - When you first open the app, it may need to check for backend availability
   - Our backend runs on Render.com free tier, which may need a few minutes to "wake up" if it's been inactive
   - The app will automatically connect once the backend is available

## App Bundle (.aab) Information

The `PiglioTech-1.0.0.aab` file is an Android App Bundle, which is designed for submission to the Google Play Store and not for direct installation on devices. It contains optimized code for different device configurations.

## Verification

To verify the integrity of your download, you can use the SHA-256 checksums provided in the `PiglioTech-1.0.0-checksums.txt` file.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with installation, ensure your Android version is 8.0 (Oreo) or higher
- Make sure you have sufficient storage space on your device
- If the app displays a "Backend Starting Up" screen, please be patient as this is normal behavior
